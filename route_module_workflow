# Route Module Workflow

## overview
This document explains the transaction processing flow within route modules (Route A and Route B) including source bank checks, account validation, and transaction status.

## Modules

- Route A Module
- Route B Module

Each module must have a pre-configured active source bank for processing transactions. If there's no active source bank, transactions routed to that module will fail, with an error or remain stuck.

## Steps
1. Check if wallet is routed to this module
2. Verfiy active source bank for that module
 - No active bank -> Transaction stuck/ error
3. Account Validation
  - Failed -? Transaction stuck
  - Passed -> Proceed for settlement
4. Send Transaction
 - Success-> Paid
 - Failure -> Processing
5. Transaction status can be checked post API Hits
6. Wallet not routed anywhere -> Transaction stuck

## Edge Cases and notes
 - Wallet supported by both Route A and Route B will be processed according to the routing configuration only. If the wallet is supported by both but not routed to any, the transaction doesnot move forward.
 - Source bank configuration is mandatory per route. If a route doesnot have an active source bank, attempts to process a transaction through that route should return an error and leave the transaction in a stuck state.
