# wallet-transaction-routing
This project demonstrates the **end-to-end routing and processing of wallet transactions** (e.g., IME Pay, Prabhu Pay) through multiple route modules. The system supports multiple routes with pre-configured source banks. Transactions are routed and processed based on the walletâ€™s configuration and routing setup.
